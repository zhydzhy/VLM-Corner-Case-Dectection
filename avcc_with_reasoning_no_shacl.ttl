cornercases:

Conditions such as fog, rain, low lighting, or glare can affect sensor performance, visibility, and object detection. This property enables the modeling of corner cases where weather or visibility is a critical factor, even if all agents behave normally.

cornercases:
- Fog obscuring a pedestrian, leading to delayed detection.
- Heavy rain affecting LiDAR reflectivity and road marking visibility.
- Nighttime driving with insufficient ambient lighting.

Context provides interpretive background, such as temporal windows, spatial layout, social cues, or implicit environmental conditions.

cornercases:
- A school zone during dismissal time, increasing pedestrian unpredictability.
- A blind corner that limits visibility regardless of lighting or weather.
- A temporary road construction site creating confusion in lane markings.
- A cluttered urban environment that reduces sensor reliability.
- A rural road with limited GPS signal and no lane markings.

cornercases:

- Fused sensor data combining radar and vision inputs during a lane merge.

    cornercases:
    - Camera + LiDAR fusion for robust 3D object detection
    - Radar + camera fusion for improved object tracking in poor visibility
    - Multi-sensor fusion used in decision-making for emergency braking

This class enables reasoning about multi-modal perception and supports traceability for complex event interpretations.""" ;
